The following high-level pseudocode was created as a readerâ€™s guide for non-programmers to understand the functionalities of Citizen Preservationist application. Readers with a stronger technical background will find more nuanced information on the functionalities of the routine directly in the heavily-commented source code.

1) The app opens and scans the target device for cameras to use as the main camera
	a) for phones, the rear camera is chosen,
	b) for computers, the first webcam is chosen;

2) A simple text and image is slowly flashed so that the user may be able to see the image, and are reminded to take a picture;

3) After the screen is tapped, the user is taken to a page where they can review the image taken:
	a) where the user may return and retake the picture,
	b) where the user may accept the given picture as the artifact, and continue to input metadata,
	c) the location and time is taken and recorded,

4) Upon confirmation, the user is prompted with a series of entries that provide user entered metadata for the chosen artifact
	a) where the user may quit out of this artifact and retake a picture,
	b) where the user may accept the given metadata;

5) Once the user enters metadata and moves to review, they are presented with a page that displays all given metadata for review
	a) where the user may go back and edit the metadata previously entered,
	b) submit and save the given artifact;

6) When submitting the artifact, the image and all metadata are compressed into a json file where:
	a) the image is compressed and encrypted into a text format for later  transfer,
	b) saved to a location that can be locally retrieved from the target device;

7) After saving the json, the user is given confirmation that the file was saved, and:
	a) the user may restart from the beginning or,
	b) quit out of the application entirely.
