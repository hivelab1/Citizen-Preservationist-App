The following high-level pseudocode was created as a readerâ€™s guide for non-programmers to understand the functionalities of the Convert and Save auxiliary script used to convert data points into a combined json and csv file, as well as retrieve the picture data. Readers with a stronger technical background will find more nuanced information on the functionalities of the routine directly in the heavily-commented source code.

1) When the script is loaded, it is designed for ease to work in the same directory it is placed, such that the directory is formatted as follows:
	a) the directory has subdirectories.
	b) the subdirectories are categorized by the date the data was taken.
	c) the subdirectories contain json files with the following metadata fields:
		"Access Restrictions"
"Campus/Unit"
"Copyright Status"
"Creator"
"Date"
"Description 1"
"Description 1 Type"
"Description 2"
"Description 2 Type"
"Extent"
"Identifier"
"Language"
"Language Code"
"Place 1 Authority ID"
"Place 1 Coordinates"
"Place 1 Name"
"Subject"
"Subject (Name) 1 Name Type"
"Coverage"
"Title"
"Type"
"Artifact Group"
"Artifact Type"
"Condition"
"Artifact Category"
"Material"

2) The script will then traverse every folder, and do the following for each folder:
a) create two folders to store the recovered image files, and singular csvs for specialized use.
b) create and keep track of manifest jsons and csvs for each dated folder, to be stored in the parent directory.
	c) loads and records every single data point.
	d) writes image to /Pictures.
	e) writes csv to /CSVs.
	f) then, once all data is recorded,
		1) writes all jsons to ./{date}.json.
		2) writes all csvs to ./{date}.csv.
